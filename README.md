# NotifyMe
XGrid Task

NOTE: The task was in Angular 7, and I have mostly experience in React, So I only knew only React tools like Redux, React, Redux-persist and other React stack.
But for the sack of the task and the observation that i will be needing Angular on the job. I decided to learn the thing and complete the task,

New things I learned from scratch
• Angular 7
• State Management (NgRx) (I have already known redux and flux architecture, so it some what easier to understand)



Now to the introduction of the task

Things used in this project 

• HTML 5
• CSS 3
• JavaScript (ES 5 / 6) and Angular 7
• Observables & RxJs
• State Management (NgRx)
• Nodejs/Express
• MongoDB
• Socket.io (to get the realtime notification as someone sends it)
• Bootstrap (to make interface little bit faster)

There are two folders
• my-app (containes angular webpage)
• api (containes node.js apis)

**APIS**
First in api folder you need to run these commands
`npm i`
then you need to start mongo and also node server using

    mongod
    nodemon server

if you might need to install nodemon as global package using

    npm i nodemon -g
  
 install mongo from here
 [https://www.mongodb.com/](https://www.mongodb.com/)

**My-App Website**

start the app by writing

    ng server --port

there are three routes in application

 - localhost:port/auth (for authentication)
 - localhost:port/ (this the root where dashboard lies with notification, you will routed to /auth if not signed in for the first time)
 - locahost:port/demo (this is the simulator where you can send notification to perticular user)

**/auth**
![login and register page](https://i.imgur.com/KvdW04t.png)

you need to register

> all things can be dummy because there is no email verification. after
> registration, you will redirected to dashboard page

**Dashboard**
   
 ![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/WtOlOdi.png)
here you see popup notification and notification list which can be deleted and updated.

There are three type of popup notification

>  1. Red - Error
>  2. Green - Info - It will be disappeared in 10 seconds
>  3. Yellow - Warning

Note : 

> to update you might change one of the fields then the update button
> will be enabled

**/demo (the simulator to generate notification)**

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/k9yjUYe.png)

> go to this url in a new tab.

when you add a notification here it will shown to the user immediatly thanks to socket.io 

> 1. Email is the most important parameter, enter the email with you have registered before to see the notification.
> 2. All fields are required.
